## Features

- Preprocessing with resizing and tensor conversion
- CNN architecture with two convolutional layers plus batch normalization
- Training with cross-entropy loss and SGD optimizer
- Validation accuracy evaluation after each epoch
- Visualization of sample images and training results

## Environment and Dependencies

- Python 3.7 or later
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- matplotlib

## Usage
